# payload2rdf

**Extract structured metadata from WARC HTML payloads and convert it to RDF.**

`payload2rdf` is a Python-based tool that processes HTML content embedded in WARC (Web ARChive) files, extracts metadata using [extruct](https://github.com/scrapinghub/extruct), and serializes the result as RDF using common vocabularies such as [Dublin Core](http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/).

  - JSON-LD
  - Microdata

  - Open Graph
  - Microformats
- Falls back to `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` if no structured data is found
- Outputs RDF in XML serialization (compatible with common triple stores)
- Designed for integration with large-scale WARC workflows

```bash
python extract.py <url> <html_file>
```
